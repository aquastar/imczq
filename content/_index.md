        **Research Interest**: My research focuses on graph dynamics, leveraging methodologies such as spectral graph theory, uncertainty quantification, higher-order analysis, and physics-inspired approaches. Currently, I am particularly interested in the dynamics of coupled and interdependent networks. 
        My collaborations span diverse applications, including Social network [^1], Transportation [^2], Spatial epidemiology, ecological network [^3], Brain network [^4], Genetics [^5], Circuit [^6].
        Also, I have been working on spectral method [^7], Uncertainty Quantification [^8], LLM/transformers, AI education [^9]
