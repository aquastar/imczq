# Recommendation for Conference Credit Toward Graduation


To encourage publications in well-regarded conferences, credits are assigned based on the conference level. A total of **8 credits** is a good milestone to aim for.

Different conferences may have significantly different style preferences; therefore, it is advisable to consult with your advisor for suggestions before submitting your work.

## Credit Assignment Rules

| Level | First Publication Credit | Subsequent Publication Credit |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| **3**     | 3                        | 4                            |
| **2**     | 2                        | 2                            |
| **1**     | 1                        | 0.5                          |

### Strategy for Graduation

- Prioritize **Level 3** conferences to maximize credits.
- Continue submitting to **Level 2** conferences as they provide stable credit.
- Avoid excessive publications in **Level 1** conferences, as their credit diminishes.

### Example

| Publications | Level 3 (e.g., NeurIPS) | Level 2 (e.g., WSDM) | Level 1 (e.g., ICWSM) | Total Credits |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| 1           | 3                    | 2                 | 1                | 3, 2, 1       |
| 2           | 3 + 4 = 7             | 2 + 2 = 4         | 1 + 0.5 = 1.5    | 7, 4, 1.5     |
| 3           | 3 + 4 + 4 = 11        | 2 + 2 + 2 = 6     | 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2 | 11, 6, 2     |
