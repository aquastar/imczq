I have been working on graph dynamics in methodology as well as in many real world applications.
## <!--more-->

- Social network [^1]
- Transportation [^2]
- Spatial epidemiology, ecological network [^3]
- Brain network [^4]
- Genetics [^5]
- Circuit [^6]

Also, I have been working on spectral method [^7], Uncertainty Quantification [^8], LLM/transformers, AI education [^9]
