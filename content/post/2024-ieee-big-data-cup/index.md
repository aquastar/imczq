We invite industrial, government, and academic organizations to submit proposals to organize a Data Challenge for the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2024, https://bigdataieee.org/BigData2024/index.html). Data Challenges are analytics and programming contests based on datasets released by the organizations sponsoring the competitions. These contests will run for several months, with winners announced in the IEEE BigData 2024 in December 15-18, 2024 at Washington DC, USA.

The IEEE Big Data conference series started in 2013 has established itself as the top tier research conference in Big Data.  

1. The first conference IEEE Big Data 2013 (  http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2013/ regular paper acceptance  rate: 17.0%) was held in Santa Clara, CA from Oct 6-9, 2013 with more  than  400 registered participants from 40 countries. 
2. The IEEE Big Data 2021 ( http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2021/ ,  regular paper acceptance rate: 20.0%) was held online, Dec 15-18, 2021 with close to 1089 registered participants from 52 countries
3. The IEEE Big Data 2022 ( http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2022/ ,  regular paper acceptance rate: 20.0%) was held online, Dec 17-20, 2022 with close to 1250 registered participants from 54 countries
4. The IEEE Big Data 2023 (http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2023/ ,  regular paper acceptance rate: 17.4%) was held online, Dec 15-18, 2023 with close to 950 registered participants from 50 countries

Strong proposals will release interesting and novel datasets to the participants and propose tasks that are challenging, yet achievable within the expected timeline. To encourage broad participation in the challenge competition, tasks and data should be made publicly accessible where possible.
We will consider topics from (but not limited to) the following big data application domains: 

* Mobility
* Health and wellness
* Finance and Business Forecasting
* Advanced manufacturing
* Retail and e-commerce
* Smart City and Community
* Blockchain Technology
* Transportation and autonomous driving
* Cybersecurity, Cyber Intelligence and Defense
* Scientific Discovery
* Food, Nutrition and Environment
* Internet of Things Data Analytics
* Data science for equality, inclusion and well-being challenges
* Big Data Analytics for Humanitarian Crises
* Responsible AI and Data Ethics
  Foundation Models 

The Challenges involve a released dataset and a well-defined problem with clear evaluation metrics. The challenges run on a data competition platform (e.g., Kaggle) that maintains a leaderboard for the participants. Final winners are selected based on their standing on the leaderboard, and a 6-page report describing their algorithms and results. There will be a workshop in the IEEE BigData 2024 conference in which the invited teams will be able to present their solution.

Tentative Competition Timeline. 

* Step 1 - Solicitation of big data problems/topics, April 15, 2024
* Step 2 - Proposal evaluation and selection of topics/problems, April 25, 2024
* Step 3 - Data Release, Platform setup and solicitation of challenge participants, May 1, 2024
* Step 4 -  Deadline for contest teams to submit letter of intent, June 10, 2024
* Step 5 - Deadline for contest teams to submit final report and solutions, November 10, 2024
* Step 6 - Announcement of winning teams, Nov 25, 2024

Data Challenge Proposal Format
Proposals should answer the following questions:

* Who are the organizers? Provide the names, affiliations, contact information, and brief bio of the organizers.
* Which sector does the proposed Data Challenge belong to?
* What is the dataset to be released? If there are privacy concerns regarding the data, we advise that the organizers first seek clearance from the legal department of their organization regarding the dataset release.
* What prizes will be offered? Note that cash prizes will be shared between competitors and BigData, to defray the expenses of hosting demonstrations of the finalistsâ€™ submissions at BigData.
* Do you require source code with submissions?

Challenge Specific Questions:

* What are the task and the evaluation metrics?
* What competition infrastructure will be used? Our default hosting platform is Kaggle, which may impose fees to be borne by Challenge organizers. If you prefer to host it on your own infrastructure, specify the reasons and the resources you can commit for running the competition.

Deadline for proposal Submission: April 15, 2024. Please submit the proposal:
