# Course Description

This course will cover the fundamental concepts of machine learning as well as its applications, such as supervised, unsupervised learning, neural networks, optimization. Along the way, the course also provides essential learning techniques such as optimization, overfitting, the importance of data, training caveats, etc. The assignments explore critical concepts and simple applications, and the course term paper project allows a flexible and in-depth exploration of a particular domain. By the end of the course, you will have a working knowledge of machine learning models, be able to implement and train them given typical real-world problems.

# Learning Objectives

This course aims to introduce the fundamental theories and the state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning, deep learning, and several cutting-edge techniques. Students are expected to participate in the course project and apply the learned concepts to real-world problem-solving. The ultimate goal of this course is to sharpen the problem-solving skills of the students and prepare them with this unique set of expertise for the increasing demands in the IT industry and in-depth advanced research.

| Letter Grade | Range         |
|--------------|---------------|
| A            | 100% to 90%   |
| B            | < 90% to 80%  |

| F            | < 60% to 0%   |

# Examinations and Assignments
All assignments must have your name, student ID and course name/ number. Examinations will heavily emphasize the conceptual understanding of the material. No make-up exams will be given for any other reason than those approved by the college office (serious illness, medical emergency). The exam format will be a mixture of multiple-choice questions and short/long answer questions. If you do not think that your test was graded appropriately, you need to send a valid written explanation for the requested change. This must be done within three days from the date the test was returned to you.

# Late Submission Policy
Assignments are required to be submitted by the specified deadlines. Subsequent to the deadline, a penalty of 1% will be deducted from the total score for each hour past the due time, up to a maximum deduction of 50%. If an assignment is submitted after the in-class homework explanation (typically occurring 1-2 weeks post-deadline), submissions will not be accepted, resulting in a score of 0 for the assignment.
