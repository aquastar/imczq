I am an assistant professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Mississippi State University. I am now working on dynamics behaviors over graphs/networks, see [my research interest]({{< relref "/post/research-interest" >}}). For students who are interested in my research, please check ways to [work with me]({{< relref "/post/work-with-me" >}}).
