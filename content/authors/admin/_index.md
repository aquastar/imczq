I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science & Engineering at Mississippi State University, focusing on **dynamics over graphs** (see details of **[my research interests]({{< relref "/post/research-interests" >}})**).
I obtained my Ph.D. at Virginia Tech in 2020, under the supervision of [Dr. Chang-Tien Lu](https://people.cs.vt.edu/~ctlu/).
For students interested in me, check ways to [work with me]({{< relref "/post/work-with-me" >}}). If interested in my courses, please check the [course syllabi]({{< relref "/teach" >}}).
